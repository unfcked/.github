# 🇺🇳 UNFCK

The **United Nations Framework for Kindness and Collaboration** is a fictitious organization dedicated to advancing the United Nations digital ecosystem by creating open websites that inspire innovation and increase transparency.

We stand in the tradition of [bund.dev](https://github.com/bundesAPI), [g0v.tw](https://github.com/g0v), and other citizen initiatives around the world.

We aim to disrupt constructively.
